# Artificial Intelligence

Brief application related with search algoritms: Uniform cost , A* to get a robot from 
a start point "0" to a goal point "7" into a square matriz filled with obstacles (2,3,4,5,6). 

# Especifications

This project runs in python 2.7, and It needs the libraries
PyQt4 (GUI), matplotlib, networkx, python-pygraphviz (graphical Tree representation)

# Requirements

* sudo pip install networkx
* sudo apt-get install -y python-pygraphviz
* sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
* sudo apt-get install python-qt4
* sudo apt-get install python-tk

# Executing the application 

> python Main.py

# Other Files
* **env.txt** it's a plain text file that describes the environment on witch the robot "R" have to be moved by the selected search algoritm.
* **test.dot** is a file that use python-pygraphviz to represent the search tree in a text manner.
